Shubham presented Pirateship at Prof. Dahlia Malkhi's research group on Aug 21, 2025.
The slides are [here](/presentations/PirateShip_UCSBTalk.pptx).

First half of the slides is the same as the [high-level discussion at Confidential Computing Summit](/docs/presentation/ccsummit).
It dives deeper into the technique from Slide 27 onwards and has more results.
